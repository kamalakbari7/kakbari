## Hi there :wave:

**About me:** I am currently a Geomatics PhD Candidate (Spatial Information Science) in the Infrastructure Department at Melbourne University, and working on Causal Inference in spatial and geographical processes. I studied Bachelor of engineering and Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing for my master's degree. I have had experiences in different environmental, health, human behaviour, and data management projects. I also have more than seven years of teaching experience. 

**My interests:** Spatial Analysis, Causal Inference, Agent-Based Modelling, Mobility Analysis, GeoMarketing, Spatial Data Mining, and Spatial Data Management

**Skills:** Teamwork, Leadership, Programming Languages( Python and R), Tools and software (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, FME, ENVI, Tableau, Shiny in R & Python, and ERDAS)

**Current activities:** Developing a Python package related to my research and finalising the thesis


  
  "Spatial data science can be viewed as a subset of generic “data science” that focuses on the special characteristics of spatial data, i.e., the importance of “where.” Data science is often referred to as the science of extracting meaningful information from data. In this context, it is useful to stress the difference between standard (i.e., non-spatial) data science applied to spatial data on the one hand and spatial data science on the other. The former treats spatial information, such as the latitude and longitude of data points as simply an additional variable, but otherwise does not adjust analytical methods or software tools. In contrast, “true” spatial data science treats location, distance, and spatial interaction as core aspects of the data and employs specialized methods and software to store, retrieve, explore, analyze, visualize and learn from such data. In this sense, spatial data science relates to data science as spatial statistics to statistics, spatial databases to databases, and geocomputation to computation."
